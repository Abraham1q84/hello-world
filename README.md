# hello-world
First repository

Hi there, what are you doing here? This is my first repository, I'm learking github and then I will learn javascript. The 2020 will be the year to speak the same languaje that the developers speak. Very cool for a VP of Operations right?

OK, look like now I know how to use github this is the flow:
1.- Commit. Basically I will make all the changes to my code here.
2.- Open a Pull request. I'm proposing some changes to someone review. During this step my coworker will see the diference between my own branch and master branch.
3.- Merge the Pull request. Once the code was reviewed by a coworker, it's time to merge all the changes.

CORRECT VERSION
